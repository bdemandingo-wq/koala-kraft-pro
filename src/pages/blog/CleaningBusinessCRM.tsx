                    Consider Your Service Types
                  </h3>
                  <p className="text-muted-foreground">Recurring residential cleaning needs different features than one-time commercial jobs. Look for software with flexible pricing (per hour, per room, per sqft) and recurring booking management.</p>

                    Evaluate Total Cost
                  </h3>
                  <p className="text-muted-foreground">Look beyond the base price. Many competitors charge per user, charge extra for SMS, or limit features on lower tiers. TIDYWISE includes unlimited users and all features for $50/month.</p>

                <div className="bg-card border border-border rounded-lg p-5">
